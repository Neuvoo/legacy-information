Welcome
=======
We're heavily revising our wiki. There will be buggy links and out-of-date guides. Bear with us as we get our footing to launch, once again, into the world of embedded.

Welcome the Neuvoo project! You can read all about [who we are and what our goals are](about-us.md), or you can use one of the handy links below. If you ever get stuck, 
find a bug, or have an idea, please join us in conversation in [IRC](http://neuvoo.org:9090/?channels=neuvoo).

We send out a huge [thanks](thanks.md) to those who helped us, directly or indirectly, by writing documentation, tools, patches or just answering our questions.

We're Here to Help!
===================
Gentoo isn't always easy to install or mess with. Please use our support channels, such as our IRC channel and mailing list, if you ever get stuck!
