This tutorial discusses over how to compile a stage1, stage2, and stage3. It will then discuss how to make a stage4, and how to mimic our stage4's so you can tweak them 
while keeping other parts.

Cross-compiling stages is another matter altogether. You can find documentation on that at [[Hand-craft an Image]]

== Prerequisites ==
* You should have a Gentoo installation. Metro is also Gentoo-focused, and wants Gentoo software. If you don't have Gentoo installed, just 
[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ install it] to a folder instead of a partition, and chroot into that folder.
* You should already have an idea of what you want in terms of packages and USE flags.
* You should be able to understand the variety of error messages that emerge might spit out. Debugging compilation errors doesn't have to be a piece of cake, but you 
should be able to find out what the errors mean and how to resolve them (whether that be patching or reporting a bug) on your own.
