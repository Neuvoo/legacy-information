The ext3 file-system is recommended, only because it's widely used and supported, and its journal is worth the extra writes needed to use it for stability in the event 
of an unexpected shutdown. (If you have an alternative in mind that you have experience with, feel free to pick that one instead.)

Use the tool of your choice to create as many partitions as you see fit. If you have not managed partitions and imaginative /etc/fstab configurations, it's highly 
recommended you stick to one partition, and store everything inside of that.

If you want the simplicity of one partition, but also want swap, consider a swap file, which will be addressed later.
