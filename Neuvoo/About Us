== Project Goals ==
While we are a loose group of Gentoo lovers, we do have some common goals that define this project. As a project, we want to...

* ...make the full Gentoo experience practical on embedded devices (see below for a list). This includes a fully accelerated X11 desktop environment for those who want 
it, where available drivers allow for it.
* ...make it easy to contribute to Gentoo in the embedded arena (and others as necessary) by providing a supportive and friendly environment, similar to the sunrise 
overlay.
* ...document all our work so that future developers do not have to go through the hoops we jumped to get to this point.
* ...work with official Gentoo to make sure as much of our work benefits more than just Neuvoo users.

We are limited by manpower and hardware to supporting the following devices:

* armv7a
** BeagleBoard / DevKit8000
** Touchbook
** Pandora
** Overo
** Pandaboard

== Dedicated Developers ==
Here are the nicknames of the people who signed up permanently for this project in the foreseeable future and have write access to the Neuvoo repositories:

* viridior (admin) supports BeagleBoard, Touchbook, Overo and Pandaboard
* javaJake (admin) supports BeagleBoard and Pandora
* bearsh (developer) supports DevKit 8000
